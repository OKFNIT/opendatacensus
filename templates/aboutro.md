    About the Open Data Index
    <br />
    <small>
      The Open Data Index assesses the state of <a href="http://okfn.org/opendata/">open data</a> around the world, based on submissions by a global community of open data advocates and experts.

<div class="span8">
<p>An increasing number of governments have now committed to open up data but how much data is actually being released? What kind of data is this and in what format? Which countries are the most advanced and which are lagging in relation to open data?</p>

<p>The Open Data Index has been developed to help answer these sorts of questions. It collects and presents information on the evolution and current state of open data around the world. Once a year, a snapshot of the Open Data index is taken out to form the Open Data Index - a list ranking countries and their open data efforts around the world.</p>

<p>The Open Data Index is a community-based effort initiated and coordinated by the Open Knowledge Foundation with participation from many different groups and individuals. The [Index, then called Census, was launched in April 2012 to coincide with the OGP meeting in Brasilia](http://blog.okfn.org/2012/04/17/launching-the-open-data-census-2012/).</p>

<p>The Open Data Index is compiled using contributions from civil society members and open data practitioners around the world, to which the public is invited to contribute at any time; this is then peer-reviewed and checked periodically by a team of 60+ expert Country Editors.</p>

<h3 id="contents">What does the Open Data Index contain?</h3>

<p>The Open Data Index intentionally focuses on a small number of key datasets. These datasets have been chosen for their breadth and relevance and were discussion after consultation within the open government data community. It is planned that the Open Data Index will be expanded to include more categories of datasets in the future. </p>

<h3 id="uses">How can the results of the Open Data Index be used?</h3>

<p>The Open Data Index does not aim to create a comprehensive list of open data sets around the world for data users. The Open Data Index seeks to be a tool with which people can ignite conversations with their governments, based on their performance compared with other governments around the world. It should be noted that a number of countries were not assessed, often because they were not open enough to have an active civil society able or free to safely carry out the research.</p>

<h3 id="datasets">What datasets are included in the Open Data Index?</h3>

<p>The state of open data around the world is assessed by focusing on the availability and openness of 10 key datasets:</p>

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped faq-table">
<tr>
<td>Dataset</td>
<td>Details</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Transport Timetables</td>
<td>Timetables of major government operated (or commissioned) *national-level* public transport services (specifically bus and train). The focus here is on national level services (not those which operate *only* at a municipal or city level and which are not controlled or regulated by the national government). A 'yes' in any question will refer to both types of transport. However, if there is no national level service operated or regulated by the government for a given type of transport (for instance buses), then this type is ignored in this data category.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Government Budget</td>
<td>Records of actual (past) national government spending at a detailed transactional level of month-to-month government expenditure on specific items (usually this means individual records of spending amounts under $1m or lower). (Note: Just a database of contracts awarded or similar is not considered sufficient. This data category refers to detailed ongoing data on actual expenditure).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Government Spending</td>
<td>Records of actual (past) national government spending at a detailed transactional level; at the level of month to month government expenditure on specific items (usually this means individual records of spending amounts under $1m or even under $100k). (Note: Just a database of contracts awarded or similar is *not* considered sufficient. This data category refers to detailed ongoing data on *actual* expenditure)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Election Results</td>
<td>Results by constituency / district for all major national electoral contests.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Company Register</td>
<td>List of registered (limited liability) companies including name, unique identifier and additional information such as address, registered activities. The submissions in this data category does need to include detailed financial data such as balance sheet etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>National Map</td>
<td>High level map at a scale of 1:250,000 or better (1cm = 2.5km).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>National Statistics</td>
<td>Key national statistics such as demographic and economic indicators (GDP, unemployment, population, etc). Aggregate data (e.g. GDP for whole country at a quarterly level, or population at an annual level) is also considered acceptable in this data category. In general, answers of 'yes' in this category refer to entries with a reasonable amount of both economic and demographic information available.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Legislation</td>
<td>This data category requires all national laws and statutes to be available online, although it is not a requirement that information on legislative behaviour e.g. voting records is available.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Postcodes / Zipcodes</td>
<td>A database of postcodes/zipcodes and the corresponding geospatial locations in terms of a latitude and a longitude (or similar co-ordinates in an openly published national co-ordinate system). A database which gives a location in terms of the name of a town or a street without latitude and longitude co-ordinates is not considered acceptable unless the name of the town or street can be further converted to a latitude and longitude by means of other open data (eg an open gazetteer with latitude and longitude attributes).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Emissions of pollutants</td>
<td>Aggregate data about the emission of air pollutants, especially those potentially harmful to human health (although it is not a requirement to include information on greenhouse gas emissions). “Aggregate” means national-level or more detailed, and on an annual basis or more often. Standard examples of relevant pollutants would be carbon monoxides, nitrogen oxides, or particulate matter.</td>
</tr>

<h3 id="reliability">How reliable is the Open Data Index?</h3>

<p>The information in the Index is collected by open data experts around the world including the <a href="http://opengovernmentdata.org/">Open Knowledge Foundation Open Government Working Group</a>. The Index data undergoes a process of peer review and evidence-checking to ensure high quality results.</p>

<h3 id="process">What's the Open Data Index data collection and review process?</h3>

<p>Contributors (who may be citizens, experts, officials, journalists, or anyone else) submit information about the availability of key datasets in their country (for example, Budgets in Brazil). These submissions are reviewed by a community of Country Editors around the world. Country Editors either approve (with or without amendments) or reject the submission. If approved, these submissions become an official entry and are displayed on the website.</p>

<h3 id="criteria">What criteria matters in the assessment of the datasets?</h3>

<p>When submitting a dataset, there is a list of questions to answer about the availability and openness of the datasets. These answers appear in the Country overview page for each country:</p>

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped faq-table">
<tr>
<td>Question</td>
<td>Details</td>
<td>Weighting</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Does the data exist?</td>
<td>Does the data exist at all? The data can be in any form (paper or digital, offline or online etc). If it is not, then all the other questions are not answered.</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Is data in digital form?</td>
<td>This question addresses whether the data is in digital form (stored on computers or digital storage) or if it only in, for example, paper form.</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Publicly available?</td>
<td>This question addresses whether the data is "public". This does not require it to be freely available, but does require that *someone* outside of the government can access it in some form (examples include if the data is available for purchase, if it exist as PDFs on a website that you can access, if you can get it in paper form - then it is public). If a freedom of information request or similar is needed to access the data, it is not considered public.</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Is the data available for free?</td>
<td>This question addresses whether the data is available for free or if there is a charge. If there is a charge, then that is stated in the comments section.</td>
<td>15</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Is the data available online?</td>
<td>This question addresses whether the data is available online from an official source. In the cases that this is answered with a 'yes', then the link is put in the URL field below.</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Is the data machine readable?</td>
<td>Data is machine readable if it is in a format that can be easily processed by a computer. Data can be digital but not machine readable. For example, consider a PDF document containing tables of data. These are definitely digital but are not machine-readable because a computer would struggle to access the tabular information (even though they are very human readable!). The equivalent tables in a format such as a spreadsheet would be machine readable. Note: The appropriate machine readable format may vary by type of data – so, for example, machine readable formats for geographic data may be different than for tabular data. In general, HTML and PDF are not machine-readable.</td>
<td>15</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Available in bulk?</td>
<td>Data is available in bulk if the whole dataset can be downloaded or accessed easily. Conversely it is considered non-bulk if the citizens are limited to just getting parts of the dataset (for example, if restricted to querying a web form and retrieving a few results at a time from a very large database).</td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Openly licensed?</td>
<td>This question addresses whether the dataset is open as per http://opendefinition.org. It needs to state the terms of use or license that allow anyone to freely use, reuse or redistribute the data (subject at most to attribution or sharealike requirements). It is vital that a licence is available (if there's no licence, the data is not openly licensed). Open Licences which meet the requirements of the Open Definition are listed at http://opendefinition.org/licenses/.</td>
<td>30</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Is the data provided on a timely and up-to-date basis?</td>
<td>This question addresses whether the data is up-to-date and timely - or long delayed. For example, is election data made available immediately or soon after the election, or is it only available many years later? Any comments around uncertainty are put in the comments field.</td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>URL of data online?</td>
<td>The link to the specific dataset if that is possible. Otherwise to the home page for the data. If that is not possible, then the link to main page of site on which the data is located. Only links to official sites are eligeble, not third party sites. When it is necessary for submitters to provide third party links, then they are put in the comments section.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Date the data became available?</td>
<td>This question describes when the data first became openly available (online, in digital form, openly licensed etc). Sometimes this is approximate. For example, "2012" or "Jan 2012". If there is a precise date, then they are typed in in a yyyy-mm-dd format.<br />
If the data is not open, then this question will instead describe the date the data first became available at all. (Note: some open data will have been available in other forms previously, so the date specified here is the date it became openly available).</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Format of data?</td>
<td>This question describes the form that the data is available in. For example, for tabular data it might be: Excel, CSV, HTML or even PDF. For geodata it might be shapefiles, geojson or something else. If available in multiple formats, the format descriptors are listed separated with commas. Any further information is put in the comments section.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<h3 id="scoring">How does the scoring system work?</h3>

<p>The Open Data Index measures the state of openness of 10 datasets for each country. The overall score for a dataset is based on the response to specific questions with varying weightings - the weighting for each question is listed in the question table above. The overall country score is then calculated from the score on each dataset.</p>

<p>The score is calculated in the following way:</p>

<ol>
  <li>1. When the answer to a question is 'yes', the score is increased by the weighting value listed in the table above.</li>
  <li>2. The country score is found by adding up all the scores for each data category.</li>
</ol>

<p>As the weightings indicate, timeliness is now included with a weighting of 10.</p>

<p>One of the aims of the questions for each dataset is to provide a increasing set of requirements leading up to full openness (excluding ‘timely’ which is important but not a requirement for open data). It should be noted that this does not mean each question directly builds on the previous since some of are parallel (e.g. digital form and publicly available) but in general there is a progression, so ”No” on an earlier question may well imply ”No” on a later question.</p>

<h3 id="getting-the-data">How can I get the data?</h3>

* Underlying data for the country Index is available in bulk as CSV: (coming soon)
